# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- A compatible client (see [veil-plugin](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/veil-plugin))
- A passphrase (minimum 8 characters)
- A communication partner with VEIL

## Installation

### Step 1: Download

Get the latest release from [veil-plugin](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/veil-plugin/releases).

### Step 2: Install

Follow the installation instructions for your client platform.

### Step 3: Configure

1. Open the plugin settings
2. Enter your passphrase (min 8 characters)
3. Choose your default language (FR/EN)
4. Enable the plugin

## First Message

1. Share your passphrase securely with your contact (in person, phone call, etc.)
2. Type your message normally
3. Send - VEIL automatically encrypts and generates a cover

## Verifying It Works

**You see:** Your original message with a small indicator

**Your contact (with same key) sees:** Your original message

**Everyone else sees:** A natural-looking cover message

## Tips

- **Strong passphrase**: Use at least 12 characters with mixed case and numbers
- **Key sharing**: Never share passphrases over the same platform you're protecting
- **Multiple keys**: Use different passphrases for different conversations

## Troubleshooting

### Messages not decrypting?

1. Verify both parties have the exact same passphrase
2. Check the passphrase is at least 8 characters
3. Ensure the plugin is enabled

### Cover messages look weird?

1. Check the language setting matches the conversation
2. Wait for context to build (first few messages may be generic)
